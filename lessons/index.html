    <p>
      Learning to Square Dance is a rewarding and healthful experience you won't regret.
      People ages eight to eighty* are welcome and encouraged to give it a try!
    </p>

    <p>
      Clubs offering lessons are <em>very</em> friendly and encouraging to new students.
      Usually, the first lesson or two are <strong>free</strong>, so if you don't like it,
      you're not committed to continue.

    <p class="disclaimer">* Actually, there is no age limit for Square Dance &mdash; I was only trying to illustrate a point. :-)</p>

    <h4>Dress</h4>
    <p>
      You can wear just about any <strong>modest clothing that lets you move comfortably.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Men, since many Square Dance moves require locking forearms, you may choose
      to wear a long-sleeved shirt <strong>if you sweat a lot.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Experienced dancers may choose to wear more elaborate outfits, but no dancer will
      be expected to buy a new wardrobe for Square Dancing &mdash; just have fun!
    </p>

    <h4>Shoes</h4>
    <p>
      Tennis shoes and sneakers are OK, but you'll give your calves a break by wearing shoes with a
      <strong>slick sole that let you move more freely.</strong>
